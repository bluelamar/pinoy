TODO: update staff_hours to use the new misc.XtractIntField funcs

TODO: room rates - new feature
- need to specify Price per "Extra Person"

TODO: room rates managers page - fix sorting
room rates: row sort is funny, "10 Hours" comes before "2 Hour"
want "2 Hours" to come before "10 Hours"

TODO low priority:
currently css link header is served by the web svc - may need to change that later to be served by nginx

FIXED: room status BUG
- checkout guest 
-- room doesnt show as open right away in register page

DONE: room status page
- showing rate class, ie. "STANDARD" - they want the Duration, ie. "3 Hours"
- number of people
